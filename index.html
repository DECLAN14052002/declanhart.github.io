        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>

    <p>My name is Declan Hart and I am a pre - service teacher,  currently in my second year as an ACU student completing a Bachelor of Secondary Education (Technology). Pursuing a career in teaching has always been a goal of mine and has been passed down through many generations of my family. Throughout my years at school I have come across many educators that have inspired me to become who I am today. Having many role models in the TAS department of schools such as my uncle and many teachers that assisted in guiding me through high school. This prompting me to build a great passion and apiring me to want to become a Technology and Industrial Arts teacher, and hopefully someone who inspires the next generation of Technology and Industrial Arts teachers. 

        I thrive and excel on the idea of challenging myself towards a goal as well as building meaningful and supportive relationships with students and staff. This e - Portfolio details me personally as a future educator and my personal teaching phlosophy, as well as my journey as a professional in educating TAS subjects. The following e - Portfolio will outline my personal beliefs in teaching and learning, why I strive to be a positive educator, my beackground and interests in teaching TAS, and what the future looks like as a TAS teacher. Reflecting on the knowledge and skills required in order to teacher stage 4 and 5 TAS successfully, along with a self audit of my own knowledfe abd understanding of the skills required in Design and Technology.
