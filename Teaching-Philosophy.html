            <p class="style 1">Introducing Myself as a Professional:Currently I am half way through my degree studying a Bachelor of Secondary Education (Technology). I have always been highly interested in the technology courses throughout my schooling life, having a deepened passion for 'Industrial Technology Timber and Metal'. Throughout my high school studies I had many role models that inspired me to want to follow in their footsteps. Not only with their teaching methods but their perspective on life and the motivation, thrive, enjoyment and realising how rewarding teaching can be as a career. 
                As a direct result of having these positive influences in my life it has promoted me to want to be as good a teacher as they are. As a direct result of having this experience it has allowed me to understand that if a teacher promotes a safe, healthy and supportive working environement an increase will come in the students wanting to participate in classroom activities and want to achieve their personal best. 
                
                "The mediocre teacher tells.
                The good teacher explains. 
                The superior teacher demonstrates.
                The great teacher inspires. "

                The teachers that I had in the TAS department at school were inspirational, thus leading me to follow the career path of a future TAS teacher. 
                My personal beliefs of teaching is to encourage and promote learning and personal growth in a positive and inviting manner. My belief of teaching is to stimulate and promote challenges to the students in order for them to achieve optimum learning. Understanding that making mistakes is okay and by creating these mistakes you can learn, allowing continuous growth and the development of skills and techniques. 
                I am a cool, calm and collected individual and plan on keeping my teaching method that way too. With a safe and supportive environment where all students are welcome and want to achieve their personal best, whilst also ensuring the rules and requirements are followed. 
                I want this to be my way of teaching as I have picked up on and have noticed that teachers with this approach towards their students and teaching develop a relationship that promotes efficient work and a supportive environment for students where they want to learn and give it their best shot. This teaching approach will demonstrate to the students that you are there to support them through the course and are willing to guide them through and be there for them as a personal mentor or rolemodel. This being the best approach to teaching in my eyes. 
                I strongly believe in the statement that "If you enjoy what you do, you don't work a day in your life". By being as passionate and as driven as I am about educating as a TAS teacher I believe that by followingf in the role models footsteps that i have had throughout the years this statement will remain correct. With educating comes great responsibility, I believe that educators have the responsibility to teach the next generation the life skills and developmental skills that are required to be successful in the 21st century and that the best approach to this is to be supportive, welcoming and promoting an engaging working environment for all students. 
                I am always eager to learn and develop my skills and this will allow me to grow as a teacher, be able to share my knowledge, promote the importance of TAS subjects, and to contribute to the emerging world of education. </p>
