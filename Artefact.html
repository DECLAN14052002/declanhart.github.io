            <p class="style 1">The S.M.A.R.T. Goal framework is a mnemonic acronym that provides criteria for one to follow to set goals to achieve or an objective towards a better goal.  The acronym representing the 5 stages in place to achieve the desired goal and how the goal should be targeted. The term was first proposed by George T. Doran in November 1981 issue of Management Review. 
                Reflection:This artefact (SMART Goal) was developed as a method of ensuring my personal growth as a teacher. Allowing me to understand what I need to improve on and consistantly work on as a future educator. Personally, I believe that within teaching TAS it is vital to ensure that time management is ensured, developed and followed to ensure that all course concepts are covered sufficiently and all projects are completed within the constraints of the time plan. I am generally well with my time management and am great at following time management plans, however, I believe that you can never be too organised. This also comes with ensuring that students do not feel rushed and are remaining on top of the cource work. By including methods that I have listed in the SMART Goal above I developed potential solutions that can ensure that students are not only remaining efficient with their time in the course but are consistently learning and developing their knowledge and skills. By completing quizzes as a potential method of ensing the lesson or do complete as homework, allows for the students to consistantly develop their knowledge as well as allowing the teacher to remain on top of where students are placed and their understanding of the course concepts.
