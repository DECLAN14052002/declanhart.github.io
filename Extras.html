                        I am motivated and driven towards achieving goals that I set out for myself. This leading me to the person that I am today, and have worked hard to get to where I am now. 
                        At the start of high school I set myself a long term goal which was to have my major work in year 12 to be displayed in the Powerhouse Museum in the SHAPE Exhibition. This was a goal that I consistently worked towards each year by developing my skills and understanding in Industrial Timber Technology throughout school. I was fortunate enough to be selected out of only 4 participants across all schools in the state to display my major work in the 2020 SHAPE Exhibition and had achieved my goal. 
                        This prompting me towards starting my own buisiness related to timber products. Being from The Shire and having a deep passion for surfing and the beach I wanted to combine both passions together. This leading towards starting my own buisiness 'Declan's Timber Products' where I design, create and selling cheeseboards and homeware accessories with the ocean displayed on them. All products being manufactured and handcrafted from my balcony/ workshop with the utilisation of ethically sourced timber.
